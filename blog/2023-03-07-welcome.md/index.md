I figure I should actually invest some time into saving and documenting some stuff for personal use. I enjoy giving up all free time to help others but I should be a bit more selfish, especially since all hardware hits the fan one day and I'll have to set this up again.

I'll try to post some info/stuff that I find interesting one day also.

Anyways, that's enough commits/comments for one night.

Leaving this wonderful dinosaur banner up for some color!
