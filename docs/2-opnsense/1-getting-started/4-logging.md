# Logging

Navigate to `System` > `Settings` > `Logging`

- Preserve logs (Days): Set days you want to keep logs
- Uncheck `Log packets matched from the default block rules put in the ruleset`
- Uncheck `Log packets matched from the default pass rules put in the ruleset`

Those 2 logs will generate lot of noise that's not really needed in most cases.
